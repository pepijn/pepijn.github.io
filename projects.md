### Employee/freelancer

#### 2014 - present: Data warehouse developer at [Blendle](https://blendle.com) (Utrecht, NL)

I took a break from studying and worked full-time at Blendle from March 2014 to April 2015. My primary job is designing and building the data warehouse, although I started as a workflow developer. I switched to working part-time as a freelancer in April 2015, when I returned to university.

#### 2013: Full-stack dev at [Medisas](http://medisas.com) (Mountain View, CA)

I approached Gautam Sivakumar from Medisas after reading [his inspiring blog post](http://gs.posthaven.com/why-i-quit-medicine). About a year later Medisas got into Y Combinator and Gautam invited me to visit Silicon Valley. I made two weekly visits and worked on the prototype for the product, a fantastic and very educational experience. When university and Medisas became more demanding, I had to make a decision. In the end, I stopped working for Medisas and focused on university.

#### 2009 - 2010: Trainee 0x04 at [Phusion](http://www.phusion.nl) (Mostly Utrecht, NL)

During my second to last year of high school, the Phusion guys approached me after I tweeted about their product Passenger. I was hired and appropriately named Trainee 0x04, being the 4th employee in a tech-heavy company. Besides learning a lot about building bigger, more serious, software projects and working in a team, they taught me how to eat with chopsticks (shoutout [Kyushu](http://www.kyushu.nl/)).

### Related to university

#### 2013 - present: Technical co-founder at [StudentResearch](https://www.studentresearch.nl)
At the start of the 3rd year of medicine, fellow medicine student Hassina Bahadurzada asked me for help with materializing her idea: how can we connect researchers that need help with students who want to gain experience in doing research? Together, we turned this excellent idea into reality and called it StudentResearch. The community of researchers and students is still growing rapidly, and so is the amount of communication between them. A year ago, we [received an UvA Grassroots grant](http://icto.uva.nl/icto-centraal/uva-grassroots/ter-inspiratie/ter-inspiratie/ter-inspiratie/content/folder/uitbreiding-studentresearch-kopie.html?page=2&pageSize=20), for which the following video was made:

#### 2012 - present: [Anatomy cramming tool](https://anatomie.plict.nl)

Learning the names of many anatomical structures by heart is a daunting task. This is why I created a website that gives students a method of testing their knowledge. It is still used by a lot of students every year; especially during the 1.5 (core) and 3.1 (orthopaedic) anatomy dissection courses in the AMC Amsterdam. All submitted answers have been recorded since October 2013, and I am currently analyzing this dataset. I will release a blog post with my findings soon.

#### 2011: [Cellular respiration simulation](http://metabolism.plict.nl)
During the metabolism course in the first year of medicine, I had the idea to interactively explain the phosphorylation of 38 ADP into ATP in the glycolysis, citric acid cycle and oxydative phosphorylation. It takes a little bit of time to finish the whole dissimilation of one glucose molecule. That is why I recorded and fast forwarded a 'run':

### Various

#### 2014: [TicketSwap Bot](https://gist.github.com/pepijn/c683c3b26da66846dbcc)

Festivals in The Netherlands are soaring in popularity, so it can be hard to obtain a ticket. This Bash script continuously checks the [TicketSwap website](https://ticketswap.nl) for second-hand tickets. It was initially used for the 2014 Dekmantel Festival, but later proved valuable in securing access to the final Trouw parties. Especially the NYE party, which led to an article in the local Amsterdam newspaper Parool.

Although TicketSwap has improved their security so the script doesn't work anymore, you can still [check it out on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/pepijn/c683c3b26da66846dbcc).


#### 2013: [Empty car2go spotter](http://plict.nl/car2go)

Connecting an empty car2go (<30% battery at the time) to a charging pole tops up your account with 20 (at the time) free driving minutes. It was, however, hard to get a good overview of all the empty cars. That is why I built this website. The conditions have been sobered, so I do not use it anymore. It still works though!

#### 2012 - 2013: Full-stack dev at [StudySquare](https://www.studysquare.nl) (Amsterdam, NL)

I had not really worked with businessmen of my age before I met Marlon and Hasher, who approached me for their project StudySquare. We completely rebuilt the website and backend system, which is still used by and for a lot of students as of today. Although the day-to-day development is now in the hands of my friends at [AJ ICT](http://www.ajict.nl), we still do various projects together from time to time.
