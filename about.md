Hello! My name is Pepijn Looije which I've come to realize looks like a string
of random characters to anyone who's not Dutch. Should you ever run into me in
real life then save yourself the trouble and call me Pep(e). Unless you want to
learn of course---I'll gladly teach!

I was born in '92 on [land that didn't exist before
1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee_Works), grew up in
[Utrecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht) and moved to Amsterdam where I
completed the first half of Medicine (so I'm *not* a doctor) at the
[AMC](http://amc.nl) of the [Universiteit van Amsterdam](http://uva.nl). As of
writing, I didn't return to university yet to finish the second part.

Instead, I pilgrimaged to [Nubank](https://www.nubank.com.br) in SÃ£o Paulo,
Brazil to learn more about [append-only databases](https://www.datomic.com) and
[dynamic functional programming](https://clojure.org/) applied at scale. What
was initially a 6 month internship escalated into indefinite full time
employment in data infra/warehousing related squads. I came to love what we're
doing as a company, the country, people, and quilo lunches amongst other things.
