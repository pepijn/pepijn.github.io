Hello! My name is Pepijn Looije which I've come to realize looks like a string
of random characters to anyone who's not Dutch. Should you ever run into me in
real life then save yourself the trouble and call me Pep(e). Unless you want to
learn of course---I'll gladly teach!

I was born in '92 on [land that didn't exist before
1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee_Works), grew up in Utrecht and
moved to Amsterdam where I completed the first half of Medicine (so I'm *not* a
doctor) at the AMC of the Universiteit van Amsterdam. I did my bachelor's thesis
in [the techiest corner of the
hospital](https://www.amc.nl/web/leren/research-62/research/medical-informatics-research.htm). As
of writing, I didn't return to university yet to finish the second and final
part of Medicine (which is called coschappen in Dutch).

Instead, I nerd-pilgrimaged to [Nubank](https://www.nubank.com.br) in SÃ£o Paulo,
Brazil to learn about [append-only databases](https://www.datomic.com) and
[dynamic functional programming](https://clojure.org/) applied at scale. What
was initially a 6 month internship escalated into indefinite employment in data
infra/warehousing related squads. I came to love what we're doing as a company,
the country, people, and quilo lunches amongst other things.
