Hello! My name is Pepijn Looije which I've come to realize looks like a string
of random characters to anyone who's not Dutch. Should you ever run into me in
real life then save yourself the trouble and call me Pep(e). Unless you're
willing to learn of course---I'll gladly teach the correct pronunciation.

I was born in '92 on [land that didn't exist before
1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee_Works), grew up in Utrecht and
moved to Amsterdam where I completed the first half of Medicine (so I'm *not* a
doctor) at the AMC of the Universiteit van Amsterdam. I did my bachelor's thesis
in [the techiest corner of the
hospital](https://www.amc.nl/web/leren/research-62/research/medical-informatics-research.htm). As
of writing, I didn't return to university yet to finish the second and final
part of Medicine, the clinical rotations.

Instead, I nerd-pilgrimaged to [Nubank](https://www.nubank.com.br) in SÃ£o Paulo,
Brazil to learn about [append-only databases](https://www.datomic.com) and
[dynamic functional programming](https://clojure.org/) applied at scale. In
production. At an actual bank! What was initially a 6 month internship escalated
into indefinite employment in data infra/warehousing related squads. I came to
love what we're doing as a company, the country, people, and quilo lunches
amongst other things.

I started this website because I wanted to share random side projects that I
work on. I like to apply programming to problems/challenges that I face in the
real world. Generally that means me sitting in front of a computer and trying
stuff for a weekend and consequently forgetting about it on Monday. That being
said, ocassionally it does result in [something useful](/projects). Whatever the outcome, I
always enjoy building stuff and learning about techniques and technologies!
