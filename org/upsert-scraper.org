#+END_EXPORT

My roommate needed help with building a web scraper. As a result of various
constraints, we ended up using Heroku. There was, however, a database row limit
that we had to work around. It turned out to be a nice opportunity to play with
the new PostgreSQL 9.5 =INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE=, also known as UPSERT,
functionality. The goal of this article is to introduce UPSERT to you via a
practical example.

* Introduction

My roommate, an aspiring programmer, recently asked me for advice on how to
build a web scraper. The scraper should run on a machine that is constanly
connected to the internet, because it should check at least every hour or
so. Running the scraper on his laptop is not an option for my roommate, because
he frequently takes it with him on the road. Neither is running it on a remote
server, because he possesses none nor is he planning to spend money on one. We
tried out Heroku; a free platform as a service provider that embraces all of
these constraints.

** Choosing the right storage

The [[https://elements.heroku.com/addons/scheduler][Heroku Scheduler addon]] enabled us to run a script every 10 minutes (the
highest available frequency) that scrapes the targeted website. With that
requirement settled, we needed a way to compare the old state to the new state,
so we could send ourselves an email as soon as the website changed. The simplest
solution we could come up with involved saving the hashed HTML contents into a
Heroku config variable. That solves the problem of notification, but will not
allow us analyse the data later. For this reason, using a database made
sense. PostgreSQL storage is cheap, free actually on Heroku, so we picked that
one.

** Heroku limitations

Normally, I would insert one row per scraping run with the scraped contents (or
a foreign key to a unique piece of content) and a timestamp into the
database. In this case, however, it was not a good idea because the free Heroku
PostgreSQL database offering has certain limitations. You are allowed to have a
maximum of [[https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql][10.000 rows]] in the database. A scraper that scrapes every 10 minutes
reaches the limit after 40 days of service. We needed a way to circumvent the
limitation, since we were planning on scraping longer than that.

What if we scaled horizontally instead of vertically? Instead of adding rows, we
could grow columns and consequently circumvent the row limit. One row per unique
piece of scraped content with an ever expanding array of timestamps. PostgreSQL
arrays seem to be a good fit for this. One could implement this using two
queries. First, a =SELECT= establishes whether we have seen the content
before. Second, an =INSERT= or =UPDATE= respectively inserts a new piece of
content with the current time to the array or updates an existing row by
appending the current time. Or, you use the new [[https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/What's_new_in_PostgreSQL_9.5#INSERT_..._ON_CONFLICT_DO_NOTHING.2FUPDATE_.28.22UPSERT.22.29][INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE]]
operation instead, like I will show you in this article.

* Methods

In this article, I will only show you how to complete the task using UPSERT. If
you would like to see how you could achieve similar behavior with PostgreSQL
versions below 9.5, please check out [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/17267423][this Stackoverflow answer]].

** The query

We built the plumbing of the scraper using Python; the [[https://github.com/pepijn/python-upsert-scraper][source code is available
on GitHub]]. The Python script executes the following query--the interesting
part--every time it runs.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results raw :exports results
echo '#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sql'
cat upsert_scraper/query.sql | sed 1,2d
echo '#+END_EXAMPLE'
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: query
#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS scraps (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    hash bytea NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    body text NOT NULL,
    seen_at timestamptz[] NOT NULL
);

-- This extension yields the digest function that enables us to
-- hash the body and index it efficiently. Moreover, PostgreSQL
-- does not allow indexes on very large text columns. We expect to
-- store large HTML bodies so we definitely need the hashing.
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;


-- Capture the script input (body) via a CTE (the WITH part) so we
-- can use it multiple times in the query. Once to save the body,
-- once to hash it.
WITH body AS (SELECT :body::text AS txt)

-- This is exactly the INSERT you would write without UPSERT.
INSERT INTO scraps (hash, body, seen_at)
    SELECT digest(txt, 'sha1'), txt, ARRAY[:ts::timestamptz]
    FROM body

-- Here it gets interesting; we utilize the UNIQUE index on hash
-- to yield a conflict if the body already exists. If that
-- happens, we append the new seen_at (via the special 'EXCLUDED'
-- table) to the seen_at array.
  ON CONFLICT (hash) DO UPDATE
    SET seen_at = scraps.seen_at || EXCLUDED.seen_at

-- The query returns a summary of the row so I can use it in my
-- blog post. This part will run, but the output is ignored, in
-- production.
RETURNING id, left(hash::text, 3) || '...' hash, body, seen_at;
#+END_EXAMPLE


** The test

We supply the query above to the script below via the =$QUERY= variable. First,
we initialize an empty database and run the query twice with the =body= variable
set to =content= and =ts= set to the SQL function =now()=. After that, we
simulate a change on the targeted website by running the query again after
setting =content= to =changed=. In production, the =body= variable contains an
HTML document. The output of the script is printed below it.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var QUERY=query :results verbatim :exports both
dropdb --if-exists scraper_test
createdb scraper_test

psql scraper_test --variable body="'content'" \
                  --variable ts='now()' \
                  <<EOF
$QUERY
$QUERY
EOF

echo \\nContent changed...\\n

psql scraper_test --variable body="'changed'" \
                  --variable ts='now()' \
                  <<EOF
$QUERY
EOF

The scraper has been running flawlessly in production for almost two
weeks. Let's see how many rows have been added during that time.

After running every 10 minutes for almost two weeks, the scraper inserted just
24 records. Before we inspect the contents of the database, let's make sure that
we really are in compliance with the Heroku PostgreSQL maximum rows limitation:

[[file:/images/heroku_stats.png]]

We have to [[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE][unnest]] the =seen_at= array to obtain the total count of scraper
runs.

Let's break the 2282 rows down by date and aggregate the count of checks and
changes of content that occured that day. Please check out the appendix for the
exact query that I used.

The sums of checks and changes match the unnested and total counts above,
respectively. Note: the amount of checks differs between days probably because
of the following:

* Discussion

This scraping method only works when the website is static and the content
changes slowly, compared to dynamic websites with different HTML output on each
request. For example, some websites return a different [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery][XSRF token]] at every
visit. In that case, every scraping run inserts a new row into the database,
negating the savings of our UPSERT horizontal expansion.

* Conclusion

The HTML output of our targeted website only changed when the content of
interest changed, leading to our high checks vs. changes ratio. Using UPSERT for
scraping turned out to be a good fit for this website because it enables us to
scrape for some time ahead, while logging all of the captured data.
